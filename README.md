# df-mod2-forensic-copy

This repository contains scripts and files related to Module 2 of the Digital Forensics course. The scripts provided here are designed to facilitate the creation of forensic copies of digital evidence files for investigation purposes.

## Overview

In Module 2, we focus on creating forensic copies of digital evidence to preserve the original data for investigation and analysis. This process ensures that the integrity of the evidence is maintained and provides a reliable basis for forensic examination.

The scripts included in this repository automate the process of copying evidence files and calculating hash values for verification. By using these scripts, forensic investigators can efficiently create and verify forensic copies of evidence files, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the data.
